# Policies, Infrastructure, and Technology in Advancing Off-Grid Solar Energy Systems in the Global South

This project aims to evaluate the potential of off-grid solar energy systems in addressing the lack of reliable electricity in the Global South. Through a systematic literature review, the study explores how policies, infrastructure, and technological integration with national grids can improve the adoption and long-term sustainability of these systems. This is my final project for the class INFO 5505: Computing and Global Development at Cornell, which I took in the fall 2024 semester.

## Description

Access to reliable electricity is crucial for socioeconomic development, yet many regions in the Global South face significant barriers to grid connectivity. This project investigates how off-grid solar energy systems, such as Solar Home Systems (SHS) and mini-grids, can bridge this gap. The report outlines the critical role of policies, infrastructure, and technology in scaling these systems, focusing on challenges such as high upfront costs, lack of maintenance frameworks, and fragmented policy support. By emphasizing the role of advanced technologies like IoT-based monitoring and smart grids, the study provides actionable recommendations for fostering long-term sustainable development. Our report explores socioeconomic impacts of off-grid solar systems, challenges in sustainability and maintenance, policy and regulatory frameworks, integration of technology with infrastructure, and gender and equity considerations. Our findings advocate for a multi-faceted approach combining policy, technology, and community involvement to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 7: universal access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.
